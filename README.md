# Clean, Concise, Collaborative Code
## Christopher Miller - XtremeJS - December 13th, 2022.

### Code Instructions

This repository is set up to show how you can go from code that's complicated to understand, but functions, to code 
that's not complicated to understand, and functions in the same way.

Use this repository in line with the talk - which will be found at [noti.st/ccmiller2018](https://noti.st/ccmiller2018)

### Getting This Set Up

You'll simply need to run `yarn install` to install the packages, followed by `yarn build` to build the code, 
and `yarn start` to start the code.  this will run on port `3000`

### Folder Structure

There are two routes you can view, `/original` and `/fixed` - the two sites will be identical.

In the code, you will see `src/original` and `src/fixed` which match up to the versions we have for the routes.
